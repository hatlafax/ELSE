This file is an attempt to annotate bugs/changes made to ELSE.

bug-01: Template.lse: had some issues with the definition of
        placeholder_type and "menu body qualifier". The changes were:
        1. The definition of 'menu body qualifier' was changed to be a
        menu 
        2. The NOFOLLOW placeholder was changed to become a menu
        selection of FOLLOW|NOFOLLOW.
        3. The '...' repeater after [menu body qualifier] (in 'menu
        placeholder body line' definition) was deleted (as redundant)
        4. A new definition - DESCRIPTION - was added to the template
        file.

        ELSE: Didn't handle "/follow" menu entries that pointed to
        nonterminal definitions. This was fixed
        (else-structs.el). Whilst doing this fix, run time
        enhancements were added to indicate when the user was
        attempting a menu 'follow' to a nonterminal that held multiple
        text lines (doesn't make sense to add more than one line to a
        menu selection) and to also catch if the definitions were
        trying to 'follow' to a terminal placeholder. An appropriate
        error message for each condition was added.
