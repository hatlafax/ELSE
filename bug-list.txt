This file is an attempt to annotate bugs/changes made to ELSE.

bug-02: Emacs 26.1: Changed the way Lisp Objects are written and
        read. At least object instances of the complexity that ELSE
        generates. ELSE writes the fast load file without any issues,
        but is unable to read it back during another edit session - it
        raises an "invalid-read-syntax" error. A bug report was
        raised, but there is every indication this is a "known" issue
        - and has a low priority by the maintainers. To "fix"/work
        around the issue, in defun else-load-file-and-compile, catch
        the error using a condition-case and force ELSE to by-pass the
        fast load file and load from the language files instead, at
        the same time disabling (re)writing a new fast load file.

bug-01: Template.lse: had some issues with the definition of
        placeholder_type and "menu body qualifier". The changes were:
        1. The definition of 'menu body qualifier' was changed to be a
        menu 
        2. The NOFOLLOW placeholder was changed to become a menu
        selection of FOLLOW|NOFOLLOW.
        3. The '...' repeater after [menu body qualifier] (in 'menu
        placeholder body line' definition) was deleted (as redundant)
        4. A new definition - DESCRIPTION - was added to the template
        file.

        ELSE: Didn't handle "/follow" menu entries that pointed to
        nonterminal definitions. This was fixed
        (else-structs.el). Whilst doing this fix, run time
        enhancements were added to indicate when the user was
        attempting a menu 'follow' to a nonterminal that held multiple
        text lines (doesn't make sense to add more than one line to a
        menu selection) and to also catch if the definitions were
        trying to 'follow' to a terminal placeholder. An appropriate
        error message for each condition was added.
